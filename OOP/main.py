"""In this file I want to create a class structure for my code. This is based upon the projectvideo.py file.
My plan is to create a 'file' class which then allows for a source, target and webcam class to inherit from. 
Then a main() function will create instances of these classes and run the iteration and processesing for some aspects.
I want to make processing inside class methods as much as I can so I'm going to make the warping of images, projection and 
detection into their own objects.  
Some classes will be placed in a filesystem of objects which are in this folder."""


def main():
    pass

# if we're running the main.py file, run the main() subroutine
# this prevents issues with imported files
