# Computer Science NEA - AR Video Magazine Covers
### Introduction:
My project idea is to create either an investigation into, or a finalized app
product which overlays a video of a pre-recorded magazine cover where the 
main image model is moving. This video is to be overlain on top of a printed
magazine in real life (Augmented Reality). It should follow and adapt to the movements
and angling that the camera is taking footage from.
